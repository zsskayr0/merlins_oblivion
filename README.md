# Merlin's Oblivion

Merlin's Oblivion is my first Minecraft mod, born out of a deep appreciation for the endless possibilities that mods bring to existing games. Through the process of coding this mod, I've gained a valuable understanding of Java and the fundamentals of the coding world.

This mod introduces a plethora of hostile mobs, structures, and biomes, each with their own unique features that add depth and complexity to your survival experience. These additions vary in their level of threat and danger, seamlessly incorporating a progression system that evolves alongside the player throughout their journey.

One of the key aspects of this mod is the careful consideration given to biome compatibility. All mobs spawn exclusively in specific biome types, making them compatible with any other mod that introduces new biomes. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating diverse and exciting modpacks.

While Merlin's Oblivion is currently a work in progress (WIP) and in the early beta stage, it has been meticulously optimized to ensure smooth integration with other mods. It serves as a great addition to your existing modpacks, enhancing your Minecraft experience with its captivating features.
